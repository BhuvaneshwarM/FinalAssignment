Create an application where a users can register themselves, by providing email, password and date of birth. Once registered, they should be moved to the home page which has the codes generated by the user. Ideally for the new user the home page should be blank, but they should have the ability to generate code. A code should get expired after 3 hours from its creation. Whenever a user comes to his home page, he/she should be able to view only the active codes with latest created ones in top.
The expired shouldn’t be deleted from the storage(DB), you need to handle it.


Note: We are expecting REST API(S) for this application. Implement the application with proper structuring, modules.
(Ideally it should be a server created using express, password stored in encryption form, token using jwt, code logic -- figure out, each and every api call should have proper token validation and schema validation)
